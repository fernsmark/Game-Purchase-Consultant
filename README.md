# Game-Purchase-Consultant
CSE5330- Database Management Systems- Project

A website for video-game buyers/collectors which takes into account historical prices, market trends and recommends the user if it is wise to purchase a particular game at this time or to wait for a price drop. The skills used for the project were HTML and CSS as the front end scripting languages, PHP as the server side scripting language and MySQL for the back-end Database Management. The website included the following features:

• A user account where users could upload their gaming collections with the purchase dates and prices.

• Personalized recommendations based on the users' gaming collection taking into consideration game genre, game console, etc.

• An administrative feature to predict EMPTY/NULL values in the database. This feature was implemented using Associative Rule Mining.
